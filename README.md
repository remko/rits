# rits: Remko's iTunes ToolSet

This is a list of tools for maintaining, analyzing, and transforming an iTunes
library.

This is all probably pretty alpha quality, and tailored for my own use, but maybe
someone else finds it useful.

## The Tools

- `itunes-foster`: Find files in your media dir that aren't registered in your library.
- `itunes-shrink`: Maintain a separate, sampled down version of your library (e.g. for use with other players)
